1.       Implement a REST service similar to the one from the Go introduction session (see Code in “Files” of go-training channel), but defining different entity(-ies) of your choice.

2.       Replace the Repository using a map with an actual connection to a locally running database, using, e.g., the gorm Library. A tutorial on the usage of Gorm in a similar context can be found in the Wiki of the go-training channel. Check also the very useful documentation of Gorm on their website.

3.       Elaborate the REST service and add a service layer between Repository and API, also consider defining DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for your entity model and corresponding mapping functions between DB model <-> DTO.
